         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>S. <hi>Paul</hi> well vnderſtanding the myſterie of his Maiſters mind,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:16718:34"/> hath very plainely in many of his Epiſtles largely expreſſed this<note place="margin">Ephe. 5.</note> matter, teaching wiues to ſubmit the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues vnto their Husbands as vnto the Lord: here is the loue taught you, that you muſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme vnto them, &amp; here is the duty too. For as you muſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme all harty loue and true af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectioned zeale vnto the Lord, with all faithfull obedience vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his holy and heauenly will: ſo you, vnder your Husbands &amp; vnto them, muſt performe the like, and Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſheweth the reaſon too, why you muſt doe this, (for ſaith hee) <hi>The Husband is the Wiues head, euen as Chriſt is</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ephe. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>the head of the Congregation,</hi> and hee is the Sauiour of the whole body, therefore as the whole congregation is in ſubiection to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> likewiſe let the wiues bee in ſubiection to their Husbands

               <p>Thus you ſee how Saint <hi>Paul</hi> hath laboured to expeſſe this duty vnto you, and Saint <hi>Peter</hi> he teacheth the ſame in effect alſo in theſe words, <hi>ye women be ſubiect</hi>

                  <hi>let your wiues keepe ſilence with all ſubiectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſuffer not a woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to teach, nor to haue authority ouer the man, but for to bee in ſilence, for</hi> Adam<note place="margin">Gen. 3.</note>

I know there bee many that will not like of this, that the wife ſhould ſo ſubiect her ſelfe vnto her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, that ſhee ſhal ſtand in feare of him, and yet it muſt be ſo, for do we not reade that God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth that euery man ſhall ſtand in feare of his Father and Mother, he doth not ſay that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery child onely ſhall feare, but that euery man ſhal feare, if then it muſt bee ſo, how much more ſhould the woman performe this vnto her Husband, vnder whoſe ſubiection he hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted her as a portion of her

               </p>
               <p>Why then it appeareth that the loue ſhee muſt performe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her Husband, muſt be like the ring wherwith he marrieth her,<note place="margin">What the Marriage ring doth ſignifie.</note> it muſt haue no end, it muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue as long as ſhee continues to him, yea if it be to the end of her life: and as the ring is not of any mixt or baſe mettall, but of the moſt precious &amp; pure mettal which may be: ſo it teacheth the
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:16718:43"/> woman that the loue ſhee muſt performe vnno her Husband, muſt bee pure, holy, and chaſt, it muſt allow no mixture, no copartner in this fellowſhip, but ſhe muſt remember to performe the vow ſhee made in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God, and before his Saints at the time of her Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, that ſhee would keepe her ſelfe onely vnto him ſo long as ſhee ſhould liue with him: and this you ſee the ceremony or vſe of the ring teacheth, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore with great and good conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration hath our Church or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayned the vſe of it, and great in the error of thoſe men which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe at ſuch times to make vſe of it.</p>
               <p>And now I haue begune to ſpeake of this vow which the woman maketh vnto her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band at the time of her Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:16718:43"/> it giueth me an occaſion to take notice of the ſmall regard that women for the moſt part doe take of this buſineſſe, for if wee note the conuerſation of<note place="margin">A woman ought to haue regard of the vow that ſhee maketh at the time of her marriage.</note> Wiues vnto their Husbands in theſe times, it will appeare (as I ſayd) for the moſt part, that they neuer regard that vow they made, or know that they haue made any at all, for ſure I thinke there bee ſome ſo brutiſh they know it not, but rather thinke they bee but words of courſe or ceremonial rites of the Church, and not concerne them at all, yea, I doe know there bee ſuch, but alaſſe their errors is excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding great in taking ſo little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of ſo waighty a cauſe.</p>
               <p>But I beſeech you in the feare<note place="margin">Note.</note> of God, note what I ſhal ſay vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you concerning this matter, for you ſhal ſee it is a vow which
